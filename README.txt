Kite: A Microblog Data Management System
=========================================

Kite is an open-source system that is built on top of Apache Ignite to manage Microblogs data at scale. Kite allows application developers to seamlessly exploit the microb-length data, like tweets, online reviews, user comments on news media or social media, and user check-ins, that is posted everyday by hundreds of millions of web users. Kite is tailored for the requirements of Microblogs applications and supports efficient queries on arbitrary attributes of Microblogs data hiding all the data management complexity of such unique data.

The main features of Kite includes:
* Connect Microblogs streams of arbitrary attributes and schema from local and remote sources.
* Create index structures on arbitrary attributes of existing Microblogs streams. Kite provides both spatial and non-spatial index types.
* Add and remove machines dynamically to Kite cluster as needed without restarting or interrupting the cluster operation.
* Search existing streams using MQL query language and Java-compatible APIs. Kite automatically chooses the right index structures to access to process queries efficiently.
* Manage and administrate existing streams and index structures with a variety of utility commands and tools.
