We provide an example streaming data source that work over network TCP connections. Kite users can find the data source binaries and source files in this folder. The jar file takes an input text file that is in a format described in the file TextServer.in_lines_format, an example input file can be found in the file TextServer.in. This data source takes data from a local file system folder. The data folder has one or more subfolders, each subfolder has one or more data file(s). A sample data folder can be downloaded from our website kite.cs.umn.edu in the Getting Started page, Examples section. This example data source reads files that are compressed in GZip format and each line in the file represents one Tweet in JSON format as Twitter APIs format (see https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/tweets). To read other file formats, the following methods should be edited: (1) method TextStream.openNextFile() to read file formats other than GZip, and (2) method TweetJSONPreprocessor.preprocess(String jsonTweet) to parse Tweet formats other than JSON.
